# Matrix-Chain-Multiplication
Compute the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply 'n' matrices and determine the order in which it has to be multiplied

Implement a Recursive, Dynamic programming, and a Memoized version of the algorithm for solving the matrix-chain multiplication.

Compare the running time of all 3 algorithms to understand the difference between these approaches.

NOTE: Code for Optimal Paranthesization to be updated
